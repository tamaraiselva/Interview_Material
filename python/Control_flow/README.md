# If-Else-Statements

1. **What is an if-else statement? Explain its syntax in Python?**
   - An if-else statement allows a program to execute certain code blocks based on whether a condition is `True` or `False`. 

**Syntax in Python:**

```python
if condition:
    # code block if condition is True
else:
    # code block if condition is False
```
<br>

**Example:**
```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
```

---

2. **What is the difference between `if`, `elif`, and `else` in Python?**
   - `if`: The first condition to check.
   - `elif`: Short for "else if", used to check multiple conditions sequentially after the initial `if`.
   - `else`: The default block that executes if none of the `if` or `elif` conditions are `True`.

**Example:**
```python
score = 85
if score >= 90:
    grade = 'A'
elif score >= 80:
    grade = 'B'
elif score >= 70:
    grade = 'C'
else:
    grade = 'F'
print(grade)  # Output: B
```

---

3. **What is the purpose of the elif statement in Python?**
   - The `elif` statement stands for "else if." It allows you to check multiple conditions sequentially. If the condition for the if statement is false, the elif condition is checked. If the elif condition is also false, the else block (if present) is executed.

---

4. **How would you handle multiple conditions using if-else statements?**
   - You can handle multiple conditions using a combination of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements:

**Syntax in Python:**

   ```python
   if condition1:
       # code to execute if condition1 is true
   elif condition2:
       # code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
   elif condition3:
       # code to execute if condition1 and condition2 are false and condition3 is true
   else:
       # code to execute if none of the above conditions are true
   ```

**Example:**
```python
num = 0
if num > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif num == 0:
    print("Zero")
elif num < 0:
    print("Negative")
```

---

5. **Explain nested if statements with an example?**
   - Nested if statements are `if` statements within another `if` or `else` block. They allow for more complex condition checking.

**Syntax in Python:**

```python
   if condition1:
       if condition2:
           # code if condition1 and condition2 are true
       else:
           # code if condition1 is true and condition2 is false
   else:
       # code if condition1 is false
   ```

**Example:**
```python
age = 20
has_license = True

if age >= 18:
    if has_license:
        print("You can drive.")
    else:
        print("You need a license to drive.")
else:
    print("You are too young to drive.")
```

---
   
6. **How can you use conditional expressions (ternary operators) in Python?**
   - Conditional expressions allow you to write a concise if-else statement on a single line:

   ```python
   result = value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
   ```

---

7. **What is the difference between elif and else in Python?**
   `elif` (short for else if) allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence. If the condition for the if statement is false, it checks the condition of the first elif block. If that is also false, it checks the next elif block, and so on. `else` is used to execute a block of code if none of the previous conditions are true.

---

8. **Can you have an if statement without an else or elif?**
   - Yes, an if statement can stand alone without an else or elif. In such cases, if the condition is false, no code block is executed.

---

9 **How does short-circuit evaluation work in Pythonâ€™s if statements?**
  - In Python, logical operators (`and`, `or`) use short-circuit evaluation. This means that in an `and` operation, if the first condition is `False`, the second condition is not evaluated. Similarly, in an `or` operation, if the first condition is `True`, the second condition is not evaluated.

**Example:**
```python
def check():
    print("Checking...")
    return True

if False and check():
    print("This won't print.")
# Output: Nothing, as `check()` is not called.

if True or check():
    print("This prints without calling `check()`.")
# Output: This prints without "Checking..."
```

```python
def triangle_angle_type(angle1, angle2, angle3):
    total = angle1 + angle2 + angle3
    if total != 180:
        return "Invalid Triangle"
    if angle1 == 90 or angle2 == 90 or angle3 == 90:
        return "Right Triangle"
    elif angle1 > 90 or angle2 > 90 or angle3 > 90:
        return "Obtuse Triangle"
    else:
        return "Acute Triangle"

# Example Usage
print(triangle_angle_type(60, 60, 60))  # Output: Acute Triangle
print(triangle_angle_type(90, 45, 45))  # Output: Right Triangle
print(triangle_angle_type(100, 40, 40)) # Output: Obtuse Triangle

    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return "List does not have enough elements."
    first, second = (numbers[0], float('-inf'))
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        if num > first:
            second = first
            first = num
        elif num > second and num != first:
            second = num
    return second if second != float('-inf') else "No second largest element."

# Example Usage
print(second_largest([10, 20, 4, 45, 99]))  # Output: 45
print(second_largest([10, 10, 10]))         # Output: No second largest element.
print(second_largest([5]))                  # Output: List does not have enough elements.
```

# While-and-For_Loops

1. **Explain the difference between `for` and `while` loops in Python?**
   - **For Loop:** Iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or other iterable objects. It is typically used when the number of iterations is known or finite.

   - **While Loop:** Repeats as long as a given condition is `True`. It is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on dynamic conditions.

```python
# While loop example
while condition:
    # code to execute while condition is true

# For loop example
for item in sequence:
    # code to execute for each item in sequence
```

**Example For Loop:**
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
# Outputs: 0 1 2 3 4
```

**Example While Loop:**
```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
# Outputs: 0 1 2 3 4
```

---

2. **How do you iterate over a dictionary using a for loop? Provide an example.**
   - You can iterate over a dictionaryâ€™s keys, values, or key-value pairs using the `.keys()`, `.values()`, or `.items()` methods respectively.

**Example:**
```python
student_grades = {'Alice': 'A', 'Bob': 'B', 'Charlie': 'C'}

# Iterate over keys
for student in student_grades:
    print(student)

# Iterate over values
for grade in student_grades.values():
    print(grade)

# Iterate over key-value pairs
for student, grade in student_grades.items():
    print(f"{student}: {grade}")
```

---

3. **How does the `range()` function work in Pythonâ€™s for loops?**
   - The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers, which is commonly used to specify the number of iterations in a `for` loop.

**Syntax:**
- `range(stop)`: Generates numbers from 0 to stop-1.
- `range(start, stop)`: Generates numbers from start to stop-1.
- `range(start, stop, step)`: Generates numbers from start to stop-1, incremented by step.

**Example:**
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
# Outputs: 0 1 2

for i in range(1, 4):
    print(i)
# Outputs: 1 2 3

for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)
# Outputs: 0 2 4 6 8
```

---

4. **What is an infinite loop? How can it be avoided or broken?**
   - An infinite loop is a loop that never terminates because the terminating condition is never met or there's no terminating condition.

**Avoidance:**
- Ensure that the loop has a condition that eventually becomes `False`.
- Update variables involved in the loop condition appropriately within the loop.

**Breaking an Infinite Loop:**
- Use `break` to exit the loop based on a condition.
- Include a termination condition that can be met.

**Example Avoiding Infinite Loop:**
```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1  # Ensures the loop will terminate
```

---

5. **Can you modify the loop variable inside a for loop? What are the implications?**
   - Yes, you can modify the loop variable inside a `for` loop, but it does not affect the iteration sequence.

**Example:**
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
    i += 10  # Modifies the loop variable
# Outputs: 0 1 2 3 4

**Implications:**
- Modifying the loop variable does not change the sequence generated by `range()`.
- It can lead to confusion and is generally discouraged unless necessary for specific logic.

```

6. **What are the potential risks of using a while loop?**
   - A major risk is creating an infinite loop if the condition never becomes false. This can cause the program to hang or crash.

---

7. **Can you use else with loops in Python?**
   - Yes, both while and for loops can have an else clause in Python. The else block is executed after the loop completes normally (i.e., it is not terminated by a break statement).

---

8. **What is the purpose of the enumerate() function in a for loop?**
   - The `enumerate()` function adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object, which can be used to obtain both the index and the value in a loop:

   ```python
   my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']
   for index, value in enumerate(my_list):
       print(index, value)
   ```

##  Break-Continue-Pass-Statements

1. **What does the `break` statement do in a loop? Provide an example.**
   - The `break` statement exits the nearest enclosing loop immediately, skipping any remaining iterations.

**Example:**

```python
for num in range(10):
    if num == 5:
        break
    print(num)
# Outputs: 0 1 2 3 4
```

---

2. **How does the `continue` statement work in loops? Give an example.**
   - The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.

**Example:**
```python
for num in range(5):
    if num == 2:
        continue
    print(num)
# Outputs: 0 1 3 4
```

---

3. **What is the purpose of the `pass` statement in Python? When would you use it?**
   - The `pass` statement is a no-operation placeholder used when a statement is syntactically required but no action is needed. Itâ€™s often used during development as a placeholder for future code.

**Example:**
```python
def function_that_does_nothing():
    pass

for num in range(5):
    if num == 3:
        pass  # Placeholder for future code
    print(num)
# Outputs: 0 1 2 3 4
```

---

4. **Can `break` and `continue` be used in nested loops? Explain with an example.**
   - Yes, `break` and `continue` affect only the nearest enclosing loop.

**Example:**
```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        if j == 1:
            break  # Exits the inner loop
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
# Outputs:
# i=0, j=0
# i=1, j=0
# i=2, j=0

for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        if j == 1:
            continue  # Skips to the next iteration of the inner loop
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
# Outputs:
# i=0, j=0
# i=0, j=2
# i=1, j=0
# i=1, j=2
# i=2, j=0
# i=2, j=2
```

---

5. **Is it possible to exit multiple nested loops at once? If not, how can you achieve this?**
   - Python does not support directly breaking out of multiple nested loops. To achieve this, you can use flags, exceptions, or refactor the code into functions.

**Using a Flag:**
```python
found = False
for i in range(5):
    for j in range(5):
        if some_condition(i, j):
            found = True
            break
    if found:
        break
```

**Using Exceptions:**
```python
class BreakOutLoop(Exception):
    pass

try:
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(5):
            if some_condition(i, j):
                raise BreakOutLoop
except BreakOutLoop:
    pass
```

**Using Functions:**
```python
def search():
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(5):
            if some_condition(i, j):
                return (i, j)
    return None

result = search()
```

---

6. **What is the difference between break and return statements in loops?**
   - The `break` statement exits the innermost loop, while the `return` statement exits the entire function and returns a value (if specified).

```python
def print_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 11):
        if i == 6:
            break
        print(i)

# Example usage
print_numbers()  # Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

---

### 2. Use `continue` to Skip an Iteration
**Question:** Write a program that prints even numbers from `1` to `10`, skipping the odd numbers using the `continue` statement.

**Answer:**
```python
def print_even_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 11):
        if i % 2 != 0:
            continue
        print(i)
