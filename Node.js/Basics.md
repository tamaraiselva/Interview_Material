# Node.JS Basics Interview Question

1. **What is Node.js?**

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library to run web applications outside the client’s browser. It is used to create server-side web applications.

2. **Explain global installation of dependencies**

REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop. REPL performs tasks related to reading, executing, printing, and looping. The server contains several ad-hoc Java statements that REPL can help execute. With REPL, the JavaScript can enter the shell post directly and reliably perform tasks like debugging, testing, and experimenting.

3. **Define Node.js.**

Node.js is a JavaScript Runtime Environment that is useful in developing server-side applications.

4. **Is Node.js cross-platform?**

Yes, Node.js is cross-platform and we can run it on Windows, Linux, Unix, and macOS.

5. **What makes Node.js different?**

It is different from other JavaScript environments because it is asynchronous and event-driven.

6. **s Node.js open-source or not?**

Node.js is open-source and cross-platform.

7. **What can we build with Node.js?**

Node.js developers can build various applications, including web applications, chat applications, real-time applications, streaming applications, APIs, and desktop applications, etc.

8. **Does Node.js use JavaScript?**

Node.js is based on JavaScript and it uses the V8 engine developed by Google. It is used for building server-side applications.

9. **Can we run Node.js on Windows?**

Yes, it is possible to run Node.js on Windows.

10. **What do you mean by I/O?**

I/O stands for input/output, which helps write and read files and network operations.

11. **What are the two data types categories in Node.js?**

Node.js supports two categories of data type - primitive and non-primitive.

12. **Name types of API functions supported by Node.js.**

Asynchronous non-blocking and synchronous blocking are the two different types of API functions that Node.js supports.

13. **Why does Google use V8 for Node.js?**

Google uses V8 for Node.js because it is faster and more efficient. It compiles the JavaScript code directly into machine code.

14. **Which extension is used to save Node.js files?**

.js extension is used to save Node.js files.

15. **What is full form of npm?**

Npm stands for the Node package manager. It is used for installing, updating, and uninstalling packages in your application. It helps to manage dependencies in Node.js applications.

16. **For what type of applications is Node.js not compatible?**

Node.js is not compatible with CPU-intensive applications.

17. **What is Node red?**

Node red is a visual programming tool for Node.js that is used to wire hardware devices and online services as part of IoT applications.

18. **How is operational error different from programming error?**

An operational error occurs naturally and is part of the application flow, while programming errors are referred to as bugs that are caused by developers.

19. **What is unit testing?**

Unit testing in Node.js is a process of testing individual units of code.

20. **What is the blocking code?**

Blocking code is code that cannot be executed until the current code is completely executed.

21. **Give some examples of async functions.**

Some examples of async functions are setTimeout(), setInterval(), and process.nextTick()

22. **Which library provides Node.js with a JavaScript engine?**

The V8 library provides Node.js with the JavaScript engine.

23. **How is JavaScript different from Node.js?**

JavaScript is a programming language, whereas Node.js is an interpretation and environment for JavaScript. Node.js is used for performing non-blocking operations of any operating system. On the other hand, JavaScript is used for comprehensive application development.

24. **What are some features of Node.js?**

It is fast, scalable, open-source, and asynchronous.

25. **Can you develop network applications with Node.js?**

Yes, Node.js developers can develop a variety of applications, including network applications.

26. **What tasks can be done asynchronously with the help of an event loop?**

The tasks include - intensive CPU computation, I/O operations, GUI programming, and database operations can be done asynchronously with the help of an event loop.

27. **What is Package.json?**

Present in the root directory of a Node application/module, package.json defines the properties of a package including dependencies, metadata, and configuration options.

28. **What are the clauses used in promise object in Node.js?**

In JavaScript, a Promise object can have three states:

- **Pending**: The initial state of the promise before it is resolved or rejected.

- **Fulfilled**: The state of a promise representing a successful operation. This is also sometimes called "resolved."

- **Rejected**: The state of a promise representing a failed operation. To create a Promise object, you must pass a function (often called an executor function) to the Promise constructor.
This function takes two arguments: resolve and reject. These are functions that you call to either fulfill or reject the promise.

29. **Is AJAX supported by all browsers?**

Yes, all browsers support AJAX.

30. **How to install the Node body-parser module?**

To install the body-parser module for Node.js, follow these steps:

Open a command prompt or terminal window.
Navigate to the directory where your Node.js project is located.
Run the command “npm install body-parser” to install the body-parser module and add it to your project's dependencies.
