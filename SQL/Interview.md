## 12. The Growth Team at DoorDash wants to ensure that new users, who make orders within their first 14 days on the platform, have a positive experience. However, they have noticed several issues with deliveries that result in a bad experience

**`These issues include:`**

- Orders being completed incorrectly, with missing items or wrong orders.

- Orders not being received due to incorrect addresses or drop-off spots.

- Orders being delivered late, with the actual delivery time being 30 minutes later than the order placement time. Note that the `estimated_delivery_timestamp` is automatically set to 30 minutes after the `order_timestamp`.

Write a query that calculates the bad experience rate for new users who signed up in June 2022 during their first 14 days on the platform. The output should include the percentage of bad experiences, rounded to 2 decimal places.

## 14. As a Data Analyst on the Google Maps User Generated Content team, you and your Product Manager are investigating user-generated content (UGC) â€“ photos and reviews that independent users upload to Google Maps

Write a query to determine which type of place (place_category) attracts the most UGC tagged as "off-topic". In the case of a tie, show the output in ascending order of place_category.

**`place_info` Example Input:**

| Place ID | Place Name   | Place Category |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| 1        | Baar Baar    | Restaurant     |
| 2        | Rubirosa     | Restaurant     |
| 3        | Mr. Purple   | Bar            |
| 4        | La Caverna   | Bar            |

**`maps_ugc_review` Example Input:**

| Content ID | Place ID | Content Tag   |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 101        | 1        | Off-topic     |
| 110        | 2        | Misinformation|
| 153        | 2        | Off-topic     |
| 176        | 3        | Harassment    |
| 190        | 3        | Off-topic     |

**Example Output:**

| Off Topic Places |
|------------------|
| Restaurant      |

The restaurants (Baar Baar and Rubirosa) have a total of has 2 UGC posts tagged as "off-topic". The bars only have 1. Restaurant is shown here because it's the type of place with the most UGC tagged as "off-topic".

**`Answer:`**

```sql
WITH reviews
AS (
 SELECT
  place.place_category,
  COUNT(ugc.content_id) AS content_count
FROM place_info place
JOIN maps_ugc_review ugc
  ON place.place_id = ugc.place_id
WHERE content_tag = 'Off-topic'
GROUP BY place_category
)
SELECT
  place_category,
  content_count,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY content_count MYSTERY_KEYWORD) 
  AS top_place
FROM reviews;
```

## 15. For this scenario, assume that Google wants to analyze the top searched categories in their platform to optimize their search results. We have two tables, searches which has information about each search, and categories where every category ID is associated with a category name

The searches table has the following structure:

**`searches` Example Input:**

| Search ID | User ID | Search Date          | Category ID | Query              |
|-----------|---------|----------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 1001      | 7654    | 06/01/2024 00:00:00 | 3001        | "chicken recipe"   |
| 1002      | 2346    | 06/02/2024 00:00:00 | 3001        | "vegan meal prep"  |
| 1003      | 8765    | 06/03/2024 00:00:00 | 2001        | "google stocks"    |
| 1004      | 9871    | 07/01/2024 00:00:00 | 1001        | "python tutorial"  |
| 1005      | 8760    | 07/02/2024 00:00:00 | 2001        | "tesla stocks"     |

The categories table has the following structure:

**`categories` Example Input:**

| Category ID | Category Name          |
|-------------|------------------------|
| 1001        | "Programming Tutorials"|
| 2001        | "Stock Market"         |
| 3001        | "Recipes"              |
| 4001        | "Sports News"          |

The question is: Can you write a SQL query that gives the total count of searches made in each category by month for the available data in the year 2024?

**Expected output:**

**Example Output:**

| Category Name          | Month | Total Searches |
|------------------------|-------|----------------|
| "Programming Tutorials"| 07    | 1              |
| "Stock Market"         | 06    | 1              |
| "Stock Market"         | 07    | 1              |
| "Recipes"              | 06    | 2              |

Answer:

```sql
SELECT 
  categories.category_name, 
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM searches.search_date) AS month, 
  COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY categories.category_name, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM searches.search_date)) AS total_searches
FROM
  searches
LEFT JOIN 
  categories ON categories.category_id = searches.category_id
WHERE
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM searches.search_date) = 2024
ORDER BY
  total_searches DESC
```

## 16. As a data analyst at Google, you are tasked with examining the Google Ads data for better ad placement and customer targeting. You are asked to retrieve all records of ads from the database that fall into the following coditions

1. The 'status' of the ad is 'active'.

2. The 'impressions' is greater than 500,000.

3. The ad 'last_updated' in the year 2024.

Your task is to write a query to filter down the ads records following these conditions.

**`ads` Example Input:**

| Ad ID | Name           | Status    | Impressions | Last Updated         |
|-------|----------------|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| 1234  | Google Phone   | Active    | 600000      | 06/25/2024 12:00:00 |
| 5678  | Google Laptop  | Inactive  | 800000      | 05/18/2024 12:00:00 |
| 9012  | Google App     | Active    | 300000      | 04/02/2024 12:00:00 |
| 3456  | Google Cloud   | Active    | 700000      | 08/12/2024 12:00:00 |

**`Answer:`**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM ads
WHERE status = 'active'
AND impressions > 500000
AND YEAR(last_updated) = 2024;
```

## 17. Stored procedures are a lot like functions in programming. They're used to encapsulate and organize business logic into one unit of code, and they can accept multiple input parameters and return multiple output values

For example, if you were a Data Analyst at Google working on a HR analytics project, you might create a stored procedure to calculate the average salary for a given department:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION get_avg_salary(department_name TEXT)
RETURNS NUMERIC AS
$BODY$
BEGIN
  RETURN (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM google_employees WHERE department = department_name);
END;
$BODY$
LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';
```

To call this stored procedure and find the average salary for the Data Analytics department you'd write the following query:

```sql
SELECT get_avg_salary('Data Analytics');
```

## 18. As a data analyst on Google Shopping, one of your tasks is to monitor the efficiency of various Google Shopping ads. Specifically, you are interested in the click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (each click that results in placing an item into the shopping cart)

Given the two data tables ad_clicks and cart_addition, write a SQL query to assess the click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate for each ad.

**`ad_clicks` Example Input:**

| Ad ID | User ID | Click Date  |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1001  | 123     | 06/08/2024  |
| 1002  | 265     | 06/10/2024  |
| 1001  | 362     | 06/18/2024  |
| 1003  | 192     | 07/26/2024  |
| 1002  | 981     | 07/05/2024  |

**`cart_addition` Example Input:**

| Ad ID | User ID | Cart Date   |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1001  | 123     | 06/08/2024  |
| 1003  | 192     | 07/26/2024  |
| 1002  | 265     | 06/11/2024  |

**`Answer:`**

```sql
SELECT 
  a.ad_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT a.user_id) AS total_clicks,
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id) AS total_conversions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id)*1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT a.user_id) * 100.0 AS conversion_rate
FROM 
  ad_clicks a
LEFT JOIN 
  cart_addition c
ON 
  a.ad_id = c.ad_id AND a.user_id = c.user_id
GROUP BY 
  a.ad_id;
```

## 19. As a data analyst on the advertiser solutions team at Google, your task is to analyze the performance of various ad campaigns running on Google AdWords for a F500 client. You were asked to find the average cost per click (CPC) for each campaign and each ad group within those campaigns for the previous month. CPC is calculated as the total cost of all clicks divided by the number of clicks

For this task, you have been given access to the ad_clicks table which stores data about each click on the ads.

**`ad_clicks` Example Input:**

| Click ID | Date       | Campaign ID | Ad Group ID | Clicks | Cost   |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 4325     | 06/08/2024 | 1302        | 2001        | 50     | 100.00 |
| 4637     | 06/10/2024 | 1403        | 2002        | 65     | 130.00 |
| 4876     | 06/18/2024 | 1302        | 2001        | 70     | 140.00 |
| 4531     | 07/05/2024 | 1604        | 3001        | 80     | 200.00 |
| 4749     | 07/05/2024 | 1604        | 2002        | 75     | 180.00 |

You'd like to return an output table in the following format:

**Example Output:**

| Campaign ID | Ad Group ID | Avg CPC |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 1302        | 2001        | 2.4     |
| 1403        | 2002        | 2.0     |
| 1604        | 3001        | 2.50    |
| 1604        | 2002        | 2.4     |

Answer:

```sql
SELECT 
    campaign_id,
    ad_group_id, 
    SUM(cost) / SUM(clicks) AS avg_CPC
FROM 
    ad_clicks
GROUP BY 
    campaign_id, 
    ad_group_id;
```
