### Basic Concepts

#### 1. **What is Git, and why is it used?**

**Answer**: Git is a **distributed version control system** used to track changes in code during software development. It enables developers to collaborate, maintain version history, and manage their projects efficiently by allowing branching, merging, and reverting code changes.  

**Key Features:**  

- Tracks changes in files.  
- Supports collaborative workflows.  
- Provides branching and merging for parallel development.  
- Works offline for local repositories.  

#### 2. **Explain the difference between Git and GitHub.**  

**Answer**:

| Git                              | GitHub                          |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| A version control system to manage and track code changes. | A cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories. |
| Runs locally on a developer's machine. | Used for collaboration, sharing repositories, and version control. |
| Command-line interface or GUI tools. | Web interface with additional features like issue tracking and pull requests. |
| Open-source project.            | Owned by Microsoft.             |
| Can be used offline, as it operates locally on your machine. | Requires an internet connection because it is hosted on the web. |

Example: You use Git to track changes and GitHub to share your project with your team.

#### 3. **What is version control, and how does Git implement it?**  

**Answer**: **Version control** is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to revert to specific versions when needed. It helps teams collaborate without overwriting each other's work.

Git implements version control using:

- **Snapshots**: Git captures a snapshot of the file at each commit instead of storing differences.  
- **Branches**: Developers can work on isolated branches without affecting the main codebase.  
- **Distributed Model**: Every developer has a full copy of the repository, ensuring reliability.  

#### 4. **What is a repository in Git?**

**Answer**: A Git repository (or repo) is like a file structure that stores all the files for a project. It continues track changes made to these files over time, helping teams work together evenly. Git can control both local repositories (on your own machine) and remote repositories (usually hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket), allowing teamwork and backup.

#### 5. **Define the following terms:**  

**Answer**:

- **Repository**: A storage space where the project files and version history are stored. It can be local or remote (e.g., on GitHub).  
  - Example: A directory initialized with `git init`.

- **Commit**: A commit in Git denotes a snapshot of changes made to files in a repository. It grabs all the changes you have made to files—like additions, or deletions of files at a particular moment. Each commit has a unique message explaining what was done. This helps you track your project's history, undo changes if requisite, and work with others on the same project.
  - Example: `git commit -m "Fixed bug #123"`

- **Branch**: A pointer to a specific commit that allows isolated development. The default branch is usually `main` or `master`.  
  - Example: `git checkout -b feature-login`

- **Merge**: Combining changes from one branch into another, usually integrating new features or fixes.  
  - Example: `git merge feature-login`

- **Clone**: A command to create a local copy of a remote repository.  
  - Example: `git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git`

### Git Operations

#### 1. **How do you initialize a Git repository?**  

**Answer**:  You can initialize a Git repository in a project folder by running the command:  

```bash
git init
```  

This creates a hidden `.git` directory in the folder, making it a Git repository. It enables version control for the project and prepares it to track file changes.

#### 2. **What does the `git add` command do?**  

**Answer**:  The `git add` command stages changes (new, modified, or deleted files) to the **staging area**, preparing them for the next commit.  

Example:  

```bash
git add filename.txt
```  

This stages `filename.txt` for the next commit.  

To stage all changes in the project, use:

```bash
git add .
```

#### 3. **Explain the difference between `git commit` and `git commit -m`.**  

**Answer**:  

- `git commit`: Opens a text editor (like Vim) where you can write a detailed commit message interactively.

  Example:  

  ```bash
  git commit
  ```

  This is useful for multi-line messages or detailed descriptions.

- `git commit -m`: Allows you to specify a commit message directly in the command line with the `-m` flag.  

  Example:

  ```bash
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  ```

  This is quicker for short, single-line messages.

#### 4. **What is the purpose of `git status`?**

**Answer**:  The `git status` command displays the current state of the working directory and staging area. It shows:

- Modified files that haven't been staged.  
- Staged files ready for commit.  
- Untracked files (new files not yet added to Git).  

Example:

```bash
git status
```

Output:

```plaintext
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   example.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        new_file.txt
```

#### 5. **What does `git log` show?**  

**Answer**:  The `git log` command shows the commit history of the repository. It lists:

- Commit hash (unique identifier).  
- Commit author.  
- Date and time of the commit.  
- Commit message.  

Example:

```bash
git log
```

Output:  

```plaintext
commit 4d6f59e2d1b25e80fbd12345b6789abcde123456
Author: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>
Date:   Wed Nov 8 10:00:00 2024 +0530

    Initial commit
```

To view a compact summary, use:

```bash
git log --oneline
```  

Output:  

```plaintext
4d6f59e Initial commit
```

### Branching and Merging

#### 1. **What is a branch in Git, and why is it useful?**  

**Answer**:  A branch in Git is a pointer to a specific commit, allowing developers to work on features, fixes, or experiments in isolation from the main codebase.  

**Why it’s useful**:

- Enables multiple developers to work on different parts of the project simultaneously.  
- Keeps the main branch stable by isolating changes until they are tested and ready to merge.  
- Allows experimentation without affecting the main codebase.

#### 2. **How do you create a new branch in Git?**

**Answer**:  To create a new branch, use the following command:  

```bash
git branch branch_name
```  

This creates a branch named `branch_name`.  

To create and switch to the new branch immediately:  

```bash
git checkout -b branch_name
```  

Example:  

```bash
git checkout -b feature-login
```  

#### 3. **What is the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`?**  

**Answer**:  

| Feature            | `git merge`                     | `git rebase`                    |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Definition**      | Combines changes from one branch into another, creating a new merge commit. | Reapplies commits from one branch onto another in a linear sequence. |
| **History**         | Preserves the full history, including merge commits. | Rewrites history for a cleaner, linear commit sequence. |
| **Use Case**        | Preferred for shared branches where history should remain intact. | Ideal for private branches to simplify commit history before merging. |

Example for merging:  

```bash
git checkout main  
git merge feature-login  
```  

Example for rebasing:  

```bash
git checkout feature-login  
git rebase main  
```

#### 4. **How do you resolve merge conflicts?**  

**Answer**:  Merge conflicts occur when Git cannot automatically combine changes from two branches.  

Steps to resolve conflicts:

1. Run the merge command, e.g., `git merge branch_name`.  
2. Identify conflicting files (marked by Git in the console output).  
3. Open the conflicting files and manually edit the sections marked by:  

   ```plaintext
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   Your changes
   =======
   Incoming changes
   >>>>>>> branch_name
   ```

4. Save the resolved file.  
5. Stage the resolved file using:  

   ```bash
   git add resolved_file
   ```

6. Complete the merge with:

   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

### Remote Repositories

#### 1. **What are remote repositories?**  

**Answer**:  Remote repositories are versions of a project hosted on the internet or a network, allowing developers to collaborate. They serve as a central location where team members can push their changes and pull updates.

Example: A GitHub repository is a remote repository.  

Commands to interact with remote repositories include:  

- `git pull`  
- `git push`  
- `git fetch`

#### 2. **Explain the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`.**  

**Answer**:  

| Command       | `git fetch`                         | `git pull`                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Definition** | Downloads updates from the remote repository but does not apply them to the working directory. | Downloads updates from the remote repository and merges them into the current branch. |
| **Use Case**   | Used to inspect changes before applying them locally. | Used to quickly update the local branch with remote changes. |
| **Workflow**   | Two-step process: fetch changes first, then merge manually. | One-step process: fetches and merges automatically. |

Example:  

- `git fetch origin main` (fetch changes)  
- `git pull origin main` (fetch and merge changes)

#### 3. **How do you push changes to a remote repository?**  

**Answer**:  To push local commits to a remote repository, use:  

```bash
git push remote_name branch_name
```  

Example:  

```bash
git push origin main
```  

This pushes the changes from the local `main` branch to the `origin` remote repository.

#### 4. **How do you set up a tracking branch?**  

**Answer**:  A tracking branch is a local branch linked to a remote branch, making it easier to pull and push changes.  

Steps to set up a tracking branch:

1. When creating a branch:  

   ```bash
   git checkout -b branch_name origin/branch_name
   ```  

2. Link an existing branch to a remote branch:  

   ```bash
   git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/branch_name
   ```  

Now, you can use `git pull` and `git push` without specifying the remote or branch name.

#### 5. **What is the difference between `git remote add` and `git clone`?**  

**Answer**:  

| Command             | `git remote add`                     | `git clone`                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | Links an existing local repository to a remote repository. | Creates a local copy of a remote repository. |
| **Use Case**         | Use when you already have a local repository and want to connect it to a remote. | Use when starting a new project by copying an existing remote repository. |
| **Workflow**         | Manually add the remote URL to the local repository. | Automatically clones the remote repository and sets up the remote connection. |

Examples:  

- **`git remote add`**:  

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
   ```  

- **`git clone`**:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
   ```

### Git Configuration and Setup

#### 1. **How do you configure Git with your name and email?**  

**Answer**:  To set up your name and email for Git, use the following commands:  

Set your name:  

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```  

Set your email:  

```bash
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```  

These settings will be used in your commits to identify the author.  

To set configurations for a specific repository only (local configuration):  

```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

#### 2. **What is a `.gitignore` file, and how is it used?**  

**Answer**:  The `.gitignore` file specifies files and directories that Git should ignore and not track. This is useful for excluding temporary files, sensitive information, or build artifacts from being committed to the repository.  

**Example** of a `.gitignore` file:  

```plaintext
# Ignore log files
*.log

# Ignore all files in the temp directory
temp/

# Ignore environment files
.env
```  

To use `.gitignore`, create the file in the root of your repository and add patterns for the files/directories you want to ignore.

#### 3. **How do you check your current Git configuration?**  

**Answer**:  To view your Git configuration, use the command:  

```bash
git config --list
```  

This displays all configuration settings, including global, system, and local levels.  

To check a specific configuration (e.g., username):  

```bash
git config user.name
```  

To view configurations at a specific level:  

- **Global**:  

  ```bash
  git config --global --list
  ```  

- **Local**:  

  ```bash
  git config --local --list
  ```  

- **System**:  

  ```bash
  git config --system --list
  ```

#### 4. **Explain the difference between `global`, `system`, and `local` Git configurations.**  

**Answer**:  

| Configuration Level | **Scope**                                          | **Location**                         |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Global**          | Applies to all repositories for the current user. | Stored in `~/.gitconfig`.            |
| **System**          | Applies to all users and repositories on the system. | Stored in `/etc/gitconfig`.          |
| **Local**           | Applies only to a specific repository.            | Stored in the repository's `.git/config` file. |

**Priority**:  

- Local configuration overrides global and system settings.  
- Global configuration overrides system settings.  

Example Commands:  

- Set a global configuration:  

  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  ```  

- Set a local configuration:  

  ```bash
  git config user.name "Repository Name"
  ```  

- Set a system-wide configuration (requires admin privileges):

  ```bash
  git config --system user.name "System Name"
  ```

### Advanced Commands

#### 1. **How do you revert a commit in Git?**  

**Answer**:  To revert a commit in Git, use the `git revert` command. This command creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by a previous commit.  

```bash
git revert <commit_hash>
```  

- `<commit_hash>`: The hash of the commit you want to revert.

Example:  

```bash
git revert abc1234
```  

This will open the default text editor for you to modify the commit message (if desired). After saving and closing the editor, the commit will be reverted.

#### 2. **What is `git stash`, and how do you use it?**  

**Answer**:  `git stash` is used to temporarily save changes that are not yet ready to be committed. It allows you to clean your working directory and switch branches, then come back later to apply the stashed changes.

To stash your changes:  

```bash
git stash
```  

To see your stashes:  

```bash
git stash list
```  

To apply the latest stash:

```bash
git stash apply
```  

To apply a specific stash:  

```bash
git stash apply stash@{n}
```  

Where `n` is the index of the stash.

To remove the stash after applying it:  

```bash
git stash drop stash@{n}
```  

If you want to pop (apply and remove) the latest stash:  

```bash
git stash pop
```  

#### 3. **Explain `git cherry-pick` and its use case.**

**Answer**:  `git cherry-pick` is used to apply a commit from one branch onto the current branch. It allows you to select individual commits and apply them without merging the entire branch.

Use case:  
If you want to apply a specific commit from another branch to your current branch without merging the whole branch.

Example:  

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit_hash>
```  

For example, to apply a commit from `feature-branch` onto your current branch:

```bash
git cherry-pick abc1234
```  

#### 4. **What is the purpose of `git bisect`?**  

**Answer**:  `git bisect` is used to perform a binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug. By marking good and bad commits, Git can efficiently narrow down the commit where the issue occurred.

*Steps to use `git bisect`:*

1. Start the bisect process:  

   ```bash
   git bisect start
   ```  

2. Mark a known good commit:  

   ```bash
   git bisect good <good_commit_hash>
   ```  

3. Mark a known bad commit (where the bug exists):  

   ```bash
   git bisect bad <bad_commit_hash>
   ```  

4. Git will check out a commit in between. Test it and mark it as good or bad:  

   ```bash
   git bisect good
   ```  

   or  

   ```bash
   git bisect bad
   ```

5. Repeat the process until Git identifies the problematic commit.

To reset bisect after finding the bad commit:

```bash
git bisect reset
```  

#### 5. **How do you squash commits in Git?**  

**Answer**:  Squashing commits means combining multiple commits into a single commit. This is useful for cleaning up the commit history before pushing to a shared repository.

*Steps to squash commits:*  

1. Use `git rebase -i` to start an interactive rebase:  

   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~n
   ```  

   Where `n` is the number of commits you want to squash (e.g., `HEAD~3` for the last 3 commits).

2. In the editor that opens, change `pick` to `squash` (or `s` for short) for all commits you want to squash, except the first one:  

   ```plaintext
   pick <commit1>
   squash <commit2>
   squash <commit3>
   ```

3. Save and close the editor. A new editor will open to allow you to combine commit messages. Edit as needed, then save and close the editor.

4. If necessary, resolve any conflicts that arise during the rebase.

To complete the rebase and squash the commits:  

```bash
git rebase --continue
```  

After squashing, the commit history will have a single, combined commit.

### Collaboration and Workflows

#### 1. **What is the difference between `git fork` and `git clone`?**  

**Answer**:  

| Command        | **`git fork`**                                        | **`git clone`**                                       |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**  | Creates a personal copy of someone else's repository on a remote platform (like GitHub), allowing you to make changes without affecting the original repository. | Creates a local copy of a repository from a remote, enabling you to work on the project on your machine. |
| **Use Case**    | Used when contributing to open-source projects or when you want to work on a project independently from the original repository. | Used to create a local working copy of a repository to work on. |
| **Remote**      | Forking creates a remote repository under your user account on the platform (like GitHub). | Cloning copies the remote repository to your local machine, without affecting the original repository. |

Example:

- **`git fork`**: Forking a repository on GitHub.  
- **`git clone`**:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
   ```  

#### 2. **How do you handle code reviews in Git workflows?**  

**Answer**:  Code reviews in Git workflows typically involve the following steps:

1. **Create a Feature Branch**:  
   Developers work on a new feature or fix in a separate branch.

2. **Push Changes**:  
   Once the work is completed, the developer pushes their branch to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab).

3. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**:  
   The developer creates a pull request (PR) to merge the feature branch into the main branch. The PR provides a way for team members to review the code.

4. **Review Process**:  
   Team members or designated reviewers go through the changes in the PR, leave comments, request changes, and approve or reject the PR.

5. **Address Feedback**:  
   If there are requested changes, the developer updates the branch, and the review process continues until approval.

6. **Merge the PR**:  
   Once the PR is approved, it is merged into the main branch, and the feature branch is deleted.

#### 3. **Explain the Gitflow branching model.**

**Answer**:  Gitflow is a branching model that defines a strict branching strategy for managing features, releases, and hotfixes. It typically involves the following branches:

- **`master`**: The production-ready branch containing stable code.
- **`develop`**: The branch where development occurs. All new features are merged into `develop` for integration.
- **`feature` branches**: Branches created from `develop` to work on new features. Once a feature is complete, it is merged back into `develop`.
- **`release` branches**: Branches created from `develop` when preparing for a new release. Minor fixes or enhancements are made here. Once complete, it's merged into both `master` and `develop`.
- **`hotfix` branches**: Branches created from `master` to address critical issues in production. Once the issue is fixed, it is merged back into both `master` and `develop`.

The Gitflow model emphasizes well-defined release cycles, making it suitable for larger teams or projects with strict versioning.

#### 4. **How do you tag a commit in Git?**  

**Answer**:  To tag a commit in Git, use the `git tag` command.
The `git tag` command is used to create, list, and manage tags in a Git repository. Tags are references to specific points in a Git history, often used to mark important commits, such as releases or milestones in a project.

There are two types of tags: **lightweight** and **annotated**.

1. **Lightweight tag**:  
   This is like a bookmark to a commit.  

   ```bash
   git tag <tag_name> <commit_hash>
   ```  

   Example:  

   ```bash
   git tag v1.0 abc1234
   ```

2. **Annotated tag**:  
   Annotated tags store more information (like the author's name, email, and date). It is generally preferred for releases.

   ```bash
   git tag -a <tag_name> -m "Tag message" <commit_hash>
   ```  

   Example:  

   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0 -m "First stable release" abc1234
   ```

To list all tags:  

```bash
git tag
```

#### 5. **What is the purpose of a pull request?**

**Answer**:  A **pull request (PR)** is a way to propose changes to a repository, typically used in collaborative workflows. The PR serves several purposes:

1. **Code Review**: It allows team members to review the changes before they are merged into the main codebase.
2. **Discussion**: PRs enable discussion around code, enabling feedback, suggestions, and improvements.
3. **Collaboration**: They facilitate collaboration by providing a structured way to contribute and integrate changes.
4. **Testing**: PRs can trigger automated tests or continuous integration (CI) pipelines to ensure that the proposed changes don’t break the code.

PRs are typically used in platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket to facilitate the merging of code.

### Troubleshooting

#### 1. **How do you recover a deleted branch in Git?**  

**Answer**:  You can recover a deleted branch in Git by checking the reflog, which keeps a record of all the actions in the repository. To recover a deleted branch:

1. Find the commit reference of the deleted branch using `git reflog`. This will show you the history of actions, including branch creation and deletion.

   ```bash
   git reflog
   ```

2. Once you've identified the commit hash associated with the deleted branch, create a new branch from that commit:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <branch_name> <commit_hash>
   ```

Alternatively, if the branch was already pushed to a remote repository, you can retrieve it with:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name> origin/<branch_name>
```

#### 2. **What is the difference between `git reset` and `git revert`?**  

**Answer**:

- **`git reset`**: This command is used to undo changes by resetting the current branch’s history to a previous state. It can be used to remove commits from the history and affects both the working directory and the staging area.
  - **Soft Reset (`--soft`)**: Keeps changes in the working directory and staging area but resets the commit history.
  - **Mixed Reset (default)**: Keeps changes in the working directory but removes them from the staging area.
  - **Hard Reset (`--hard`)**: Resets both the working directory and the commit history, permanently discarding changes.
  
  Example:

  ```bash
  git reset --hard <commit_hash>
  ```

- **`git revert`**: This command creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in a specific commit. Unlike `git reset`, `git revert` does not alter the commit history; it adds a new commit that reverts the changes of a previous commit.
  
  Example:

  ```bash
  git revert <commit_hash>
  ```

#### 3. **How do you resolve detached HEAD state in Git?**  

**Answer**:  In Git, a **detached HEAD** state occurs when you checkout a specific commit instead of a branch. This state means you're not on a branch, so any new commits won't be associated with any branch.

To resolve a detached HEAD state:

1. **Checkout a branch**: If you want to return to the branch you were working on, simply checkout the branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout <branch_name>
   ```

2. **Create a new branch**: If you want to keep the changes you made while in detached HEAD state, create a new branch to preserve those commits:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <new_branch_name>
   ```

#### 4. **What does `git clean` do?**

**Answer**:  The `git clean` command is used to remove untracked files and directories from the working directory. These are files that are not tracked by Git (i.e., files not staged or committed). It helps to clean up any clutter.

- **Remove untracked files**:

  ```bash
  git clean -f
  ```

- **Remove untracked directories**:

  ```bash
  git clean -fd
  ```

- **Dry run (to see what will be deleted)**:

  ```bash
  git clean -n
  ```

- **Remove ignored files as well**:

  ```bash
  git clean -f -X
  ```

#### 5. **How do you undo changes in the working directory?**  

**Answer**:  To undo changes in the working directory, you can use the following commands:

1. **Discard uncommitted changes** in tracked files (working directory):

   ```bash
   git checkout -- <file_name>
   ```

   This restores the file to its state in the last commit.

2. **Reset the entire working directory** to the last commit:

   ```bash
   git reset --hard
   ```

   This resets both the working directory and staging area, discarding all uncommitted changes.

3. **Remove untracked files** using `git clean` (as mentioned above):

   ```bash
   git clean -f
   ```

These commands allow you to discard changes in your working directory and bring it back to a clean state based on the last commit or the staged changes.

### Performance and Optimization

#### 1. **What is shallow cloning in Git?**

**Answer**:  Shallow cloning is a method of cloning a Git repository with limited history. It reduces the size of the cloned repository by fetching only a specific number of recent commits instead of the entire commit history.

- Use the `--depth` option with `git clone` to specify the number of commits to include:

  ```bash
  git clone --depth 1 <repository_url>
  ```

- Benefits:
  - Speeds up the cloning process.
  - Reduces disk space usage.
- Limitation: Shallow clones lack full commit history, which might restrict operations like `git log` and full history merges.

#### 2. **How do you compress a Git repository?**  

**Answer**:  To compress a Git repository and reduce its size, use the following commands:

1. **Garbage Collection**: Cleans up unnecessary files and optimizes the repository:

   ```bash
   git gc
   ```

2. **Aggressive Compression**: Performs a more thorough garbage collection:

   ```bash
   git gc --aggressive --prune=now
   ```

   - `--aggressive`: Increases the level of compression.
   - `--prune=now`: Removes unreachable objects immediately.

3. **Remove Unused Objects**: Use the `git prune` command to clean up unreachable or dangling objects:

   ```bash
   git prune
   ```

This process helps in reducing the size of the `.git` directory by cleaning unnecessary data.

#### 3. **What is a Git submodule, and when would you use it?**

**Answer**:  A Git submodule is a repository embedded inside another repository. It allows you to include and track an external repository as part of your main repository.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Managing dependencies: When a project relies on another repository (e.g., a shared library).
  - Keeping external code separate while still integrating it into the main project.

- **Key Commands**:
  - Add a submodule:

    ```bash
    git submodule add <repository_url> <path>
    ```

  - Initialize and update submodules:

    ```bash
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ```

- **Benefits**:
  - Maintains separate versioning for the main project and the submodule.
  - Keeps the main repository smaller by not embedding the submodule’s files directly.

- **Challenges**:
  - Submodules can complicate workflows if not managed carefully.
  - Requires additional commands during cloning and updating.

#### 4. **How do you optimize Git for large repositories?**  

**Answer**:  For large repositories, Git can be optimized using the following techniques:

1. **Shallow Cloning**: Clone only the latest history to save time and space:

   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Split History**: Use Git's filtering capabilities to split history into separate repositories:

   ```bash
   git filter-repo --path <subdirectory> --force
   ```

3. **Use Sparse Checkout**: Fetch only specific files or directories:

   ```bash
   git sparse-checkout init --cone
   git sparse-checkout set <path>
   ```

4. **Pack and Compress Objects**: Optimize storage by repacking objects:

   ```bash
   git repack -Adf
   ```

5. **Enable Partial Cloning**: For repositories with large files, enable partial cloning and fetch large files on-demand:

   ```bash
   git clone --filter=blob:none <repository_url>
   ```

6. **Use Git LFS (Large File Storage)**: Store large files separately using Git LFS:

   ```bash
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.largefile"
   ```

These optimizations improve performance when handling large repositories, especially in CI/CD pipelines or distributed teams.

### Security and Best Practices

#### 1. **How do you remove sensitive data from Git history?**  

**Answer**:  Sensitive data, like passwords or API keys, can be removed from Git history using the following methods:

1. **Using `git filter-repo`** (preferred method):  
   Removes sensitive data across the repository’s history:

   ```bash
   git filter-repo --path <file_with_sensitive_data> --invert-paths
   ```

   - Replace `<file_with_sensitive_data>` with the filename or path.

2. **Using `git filter-branch`** (older method):  
   Rewrite commit history to remove sensitive information:

   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
   'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch <file_with_sensitive_data>' \
   --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```

3. **Using `BFG Repo-Cleaner`**:  
   A simpler alternative for large repositories:

   ```bash
   bfg --delete-files <filename>
   ```

4. **Force Push the Changes**:  
   After cleaning history, force-push the updated repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin --force --all
   ```

**Note**: Inform collaborators to re-clone the repository after these changes.

#### 2. **Explain the concept of signed commits.**  

**Answer**:  Signed commits use cryptographic signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of a commit. This ensures the commit was created by a trusted author.

- **How to Create Signed Commits**:
  - Set up a GPG or SSH key.
  - Configure Git to use the key:

    ```bash
    git config --global user.signingkey <your_key_id>
    ```

  - Create a signed commit:
  
    ```bash
    git commit -S -m "Your commit message"
    ```

- **Benefits**:
  - Adds a layer of security to the repository.
  - Helps prevent unauthorized commits.
  - Verifies the identity of commit authors in collaborative environments.

- **Verifying Signed Commits**:
  Use the `--show-signature` option:

  ```bash
  git log --show-signature
  ```

#### 3. **What are best practices for writing commit messages?**  

**Answer**:  Clear and descriptive commit messages improve collaboration and code maintainability.

- **Structure**:
  - **Header (short and concise)**: A single line summarizing the change (50 characters or less).
  - **Body (optional)**: Additional details explaining *what* was done and *why* (72 characters per line).

- **Best Practices**:
  - Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
  - Be concise but informative (e.g., "Fix login bug when username is empty").
  - Reference related issues or pull requests (e.g., "Fixes #123").
  - Avoid including unrelated changes in a single commit.

#### 4. **What is the Git object model?**

**Answer**: The Git object model comprises four major types: blobs (which store file data), trees (which store directory structures), commits (which store repository snapshots), and tags (which store references to commits). These objects are the pillar of Git's version control system, permitting for capable tracking and management of changes.

#### 5. What is origin in Git?

In Git, "origin" states to the default name offered to the remote repository from which local repository was cloned. It is used as a reference to control fetches, pulls, and pushes.

#### 6. What are the advantages of using GIT?

Using Git provides multiple advantages:

It assists teamwork by supporting multiple developers to work on the same project together.
Each developer has a local copy of the repository, improving performance and enabling offline work.
Free and widely supported.
Git supports work on various types of projects.
Each repository has only one Git directory.

#### 7. What is the difference between git fetch and git pull?

'git fetch' fetches updates from a remote repository but does not combine them into your local repository. It fetches all the new data from the remote repository that you don’t have yet, but it stores it in a separate area, permitting you to review the changes before merging them into your working directory.

'git pull' fetches the updates from the remote repository and instantly strives to merge them into your current branch. It is basically a union of 'git fetch' followed by 'git merge'.

#### 8. Explain the difference between reverting and resetting?

**`Resetting: Resetting:`** This command is used to change the present state of the repository to a precise point in its history. When you refresh, Git moves the 'HEAD' (present branch) to the particular commit, likely changing the files in your working directory and staging area. It is like reversing to a definite point in time, and it can be used to discard changes.

**`Reverting:`** Reverting, on the other a hand, makes new commit that undoes the changes made by specific commit. In place of removing or changing history like resetting does, reverting adds new commit that effectively reverses the changes introduced by the commit you specify.

#### 9. What is `git diff`?

'git diff' is a command in Git that presents the differences between varied states of files in a repository. It equates changes between the working directory, the staging area (index), and the last commit. It assists track changes, additions, and deletions before committing changes to the repository.

#### 10. How does Git store data?

Git stores data by saving snapshots of your project at diverse points in time. Each snapshot is a commit, which covers information about the project’s files (blobs) and directories (trees). These snapshots are recognized by unique hashes, creating it easy to track changes and retrieve history.

#### 11. What is the function of the git cherry-pick command?

The git cherry-pick command uses exact commits from one branch to another, allowing selective merging of changes without merging entire branches.

#### 12. What is ‘bare repository’ in Git?

A bare repository in Git is one missing a working directory. It only contains version control data, making it ideal for sharing and collaboration without changing files directly.

#### 13. What is branching in Git?

Branching in Git permits forming separate lines of development. It allows users to work on features or fixes separately from the main codebase, helping parallel development and simpler integration of changes.
